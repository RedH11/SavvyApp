  - On my phone it overflows in the intro: definitely need to make everything flexible:

  - In the phone verification part, for when I submit it, add a text that says enter 12345 to continue in the app

  FOR ALL EVENTS:
  - BUT still need to test UI when there are no events
  - AND need to test if it doesn't show events when they are ongoing

  - Add the resend code button (not visible?)

  - See if the notification red circle is working

- To get the event pulls set up from the firestore
- To set up UI for empty all events / user events (keep it simple)
- To set up the initial page where users are dropped
- To make it so that if there is already a phone number with an account, that the user can log into that account
- Allow the user to set up metamask and read from their public address
- Shorten all of the intro pages massively
- Also use the flutter native splash screen to add a splash screen
- Finish the event joined screen and the join event 

Non-Urgent:
Restyle show dialogues (like in init user, etc.)
